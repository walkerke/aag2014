## 'Baby boomer' migration

* General findings: migrants tend to move "down the urban hierarchy" to smaller cities as they age (Plane et al. 2005; Plane and Jurjevich 2009)

---

## Research questions

* Central question: how to reconcile conflicts between anecdotes around boomer migration & scholarly literature?

* Topics to cover: 
 * Geography of boomer growth & decline in U.S. metropolitan areas
 * Analysis of metropolitan boomer migrants' destinations




---

## Methods

* Exploratory data analysis of demographic & migration trends of baby boomers since 2000

Data sources: 
* Census tract-level data on baby boomers from 2000 and 2010 Censuses
* Microdata on baby boomer migrants from 2005-2011 ACS PUMS

---

## Boomer gains and losses, by metro (2000s)

* Most large metropolitan areas lost baby boomers during the 2000s

Top gainers: Phoenix, Las Vegas, Tampa-St. Petersburg, Orlando, San Antonio

Top losers: New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco/Oakland, Detroit

## Population trends, 2000-2010

* Overall: boomer population losses in closer-in neighborhoods, growth on urban fringes
* Significant growth in select inner-core neighborhoods

Question: who is moving to city cores?

---

## Migration trends by age group

## Boomer migration by income

---

## Conclusions and future directions

* Overall, most growth in baby boomer populations occurs away from urban cores
* Growth taking place around downtowns of major cities; higher proportion of inner-core migrants have very high, very low levels of education, income

Further research: 
* Where are inner-core boomer migrants moving from?  
* How do characteristics like education, income, etc. influence moves up and down the urban hierarchy?
